*Notice how the console says we’ve defined a object, but it hasn’t run either of our println statements? 
This is due to a quirk of Scala and Java called "lazy loading".

*field gives a name to a value, whereas a 
*method gives a name to a computation that produces a value.

Objects and classes (which we’ll see later) aren’t loaded, until they are referenced by other code
object Test7 {
   val simpleField = {
     println("Evaluating simpleField")
     42
   }
   def noParameterMethod = {
     println("Evaluating noParameterMethod")
     42
   }
}
